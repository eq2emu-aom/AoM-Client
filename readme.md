# AoM-Client
eq2emu AoM Client

This is the complete installed folder for AoM, Simply unrar using winrar (32bit - https://www.rarlab.com/rar/wrar591.exe and x64 - https://www.rarlab.com/rar/winrar-x64-591.exe). 

After winrar is installed select eq2emu-client.part001 right click and extract here. After that move the EQ2EMu-Client folder wherever you like.

**Note I am in no way associated with the EQ2EMu project, nor Daybreak Games/SoE, or whatever they call themselves this week.
